These are my suggestions to meeting participants in general and
architects and senior developers in particular:

- [Give your colleague's idea 5
  minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes). It
  could very well be the ide has merits you don't see. Letting the
  idea float for a couple of minutes before you shoot it down does not
  mean you endorse it.
- Appreciate that there are no perfect solutions, all approaches come
  with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Thus, make the
  meeting a safe place where people can share their ideas and voice
  their thoughts.
- Don't interrupt
- Don't laugh at your colleague's arguments.
